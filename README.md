# Dopamine
New Framework for Flexible and Reproducible Reinforcement Learning Research



## **Introduction**

Reinforcement learning is an important domain of machine learning. Which mimics the human level learning. RL has gain a lot of momentum over the past few years. More and more researh has been done in RL results in the improvements in the reinforcement learning methodolgies and techniques. Google has announced new Reinforcement learning tensor flow based framework called Dopamine. Which aims to provide flexibility, stability, and reproducibility for new and experienced RL researchers alike. Inspired by one of the main components in reward-motivated behaviour in the brain and reflecting the strong historical connection between neuroscience and reinforcement learning research, this platform aims to enable the kind of speculative research that can drive radical discoveries.
